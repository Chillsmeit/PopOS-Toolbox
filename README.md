## Description

This collection of bash scripts allows me (oor you) to automatically install Pop!_OS extensions, themes and software and configure them all the way I want. <br>
It needs **pkexec** to run properly. <br>

## Instructions:

Make sure you maintain the file structure and don't change the files or folders names.<br>

Install git:
```
sudo apt-get install git
```
Clone the repository: (preferably to your Home folder)
```
git clone https://github.com/Chillsmeit/dotfilesPopOS
```
CD into the directory:
```
cd dotfilesPopOS
```
Make the script executable:
```
chmod +x main.sh
```
Run the script **without** sudo privileges:
```
./main.sh
```
